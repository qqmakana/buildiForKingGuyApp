## 🔗 Step 3: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

### Option A: If you see commands on GitHub, copy and paste them

OR

### Option B: Run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/qaqambilemakana/Desktop/ancBoys

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/onlineschool.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Copy-Paste Commands

**Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username:**

```bash
cd /Users/qaqambilemakana/Desktop/ancBoys
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/onlineschool.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

If prompted for credentials:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username

  - Get token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - Or use SSH keys
